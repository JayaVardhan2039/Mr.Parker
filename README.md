## The Problem We're Solving

We've all been there:
- Driving in circles looking for parking
- Getting late for meetings because there's "no parking anywhere"
- Paying ridiculous amounts for parking garages
- Watching empty driveways while struggling to find a spot

## Here's Where Mr.Parker Comes In

Mr.Parker connects people who need parking with people who have it. Simple as that. Think of it as your friendly neighbor letting you use their driveway - but with added security, convenience, and a chance to make some extra cash.

## How Mr.Parker Actually Works

1. **Users Book Nearby Parkers**: Normal part-time individuals who can assist with vehicle parking
2. **Real-Time Vehicle Management**: Parkers take the vehicle and return it when needed
3. **Live Location Tracking**: See your vehicle's exact location in real-time
4. **Time-Based Services**: Schedule pickups and handovers at your convenience
5. **Daily Statistics Reset**: Earnings and parking counts refresh daily at 10:55 PM
6. **Secure OTP Verification**: Complete handovers safely with OTP verification
7. **Fare Calculation**: Automatic fare calculation based on distance and time

## Key Features

üöó **For Vehicle Owners:**
- Find nearby parkers in real-time
